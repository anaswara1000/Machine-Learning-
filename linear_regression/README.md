ML Lab Assignment 1
    1. Design the solution using linear regression.
Model the output variable "concrete compressive strength" as a linear combination of 1 or 2 important features.
        a) Plot Y against each of the 8 features separately
        b) Formulate the cost function.
        c) Use Gradient Descent to optimize the cost (loss) function. Try with various learning rates of 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001 and 0.00001
        d) Visualize the weight vector space .
        e) Plot the training curve .
        f) Generate 2 sample test cases and predict the output for these test cases.
